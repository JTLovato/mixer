# Mixer

## What It Do

Working with React, I wanted to create an app that allows you to put in whatever ingredients you have, and have it put out different drink recipes that you could easily make.

I really wanted to work more in React, and I've found the best way to learn for myself is to apply my hobbies and passions to it, in this case: Mixology. So I made a simple, easy-to-use recipe finder.\

With this project, I wanted to make a simple app, that has now balooned slightly into doing a more complete app.

## Current Features

* Random Drink Card
* Ingredient List
* Recipe Finder By Owned Ingredients
 
## Features I Want To Add

* Search Specific Drink Recipes
* Account Creation And Logins
* Favorites List
* Glossery Section
* More Drinks And Ingredients
* Better UI/UX For Sorting Through Ingredients
* Submit Recipe Ideas
* More Refined Drink Data
* Nutritional Facts
